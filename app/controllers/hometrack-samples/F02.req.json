Anything in "job" can be updated by a user with the correct permissions. The
whole block must be provided, and it will override whatever was previously
contained in the block. The "references", "documents", and "parties" arrays
require only that the items of the same "type" be provided, not the whole array.

For "references" and "documents" each array can only have 1 of each relevant
"type" enumeration. Including another of that type will overwrite the first
value.

"Parties" can have multiples of the same "type", but these must all be provided
in a single update. i.e. to link applicants as related parties to a job you must
provide all applicants. If a change needs to be made to one applicant (to
update a phone number for example), both applicants would have to be sent again.

See F02-0[1-5].
